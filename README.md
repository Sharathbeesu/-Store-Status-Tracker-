# Store Monitoring and Reporting Web Application

This Flask-based web application allows users to monitor and report the operational status of different stores. It calculates uptime and downtime over customizable time intervals, generates reports, and provides insights into store performance.

## Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

The frontend part of the project will be implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to visualize and interact with the generated reports. The files can be organized as follows:

- **`static/`**: Directory to store static assets
  - **`css/`**: Directory for CSS files
    - **`styles.css`**: Stylesheet for formatting the user interface
  - **`js/`**: Directory for JavaScript files
    - **`script.js`**: JavaScript code to enhance interactivity

## Project Roadmap

1. **Project Initialization:**
   - Set up Flask project structure
   - Define database models for Store, StoreStatus, and Report

2. **Database Interaction:**
   - Create and manage SQLite database using SQLAlchemy
   - Load CSV data into the database for initial testing

3. **Time and Date Handling:**
   - Experiment with time zone conversions using the `pytz` library
   - Develop logic for calculating store uptime and downtime based on timestamps

4. **API Integration:**
   - Create endpoints for triggering report generation and retrieval
   - Utilize the `requests` library for API communication

5. **Report Generation:**
   - Design an algorithm to calculate and summarize store performance
   - Implement logic to generate reports based on calculated data

6. **Data Storage and Visualization:**
   - Store generated reports in the database for future reference
   - Implement frontend technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for data visualization

7. **Testing and Debugging:**
   - Thoroughly test the application for various scenarios and edge cases
   - Debug and resolve issues related to calculations, API interaction, and database operations

8. **Documentation and Deployment:**
   - Create comprehensive documentation outlining project structure and functionalities
   - Deploy the Flask application to a web server for public access

9. **Enhancements and Refinements:**
   - Gather user feedback for potential improvements
   - Explore options to enhance the frontend with dynamic charts and graphs

10. **Future Scope:**
    - Extend the application to handle advanced data analysis
    - Implement user authentication and secure data access
    - Scale the project to accommodate a larger number of stores and more complex reporting features
